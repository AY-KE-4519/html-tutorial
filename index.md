# HTML Tutorial

In this tutorial you will learn all the basics of html that you need to know to start programming in html

## Basic Boilerplate

Open up your text editor and paste the following code in there.

```html
<html>
<head>
  <title>Web Development Tutorial</title>
  <style>
    /* All Styles here */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
<!--All HTML here-->
<script>
// All Javascript here
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

So here in places of styles and javascript, we have comments, but what we have to worry about for now is just the html section. So the html body is wrapped between `<body>` and `</body>`.
