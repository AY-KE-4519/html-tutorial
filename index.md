# HTML Tutorial

In this tutorial you will learn all the basics of html that you need to know to start programming in html

## Basic Boilerplate

Open up your text editor and paste the following code in there.

```html
<html>
<head>
  <title>Web Development Tutorial</title>
</head>
<body>
<!--All HTML Body here-->
</body>
</html>
```

Now save the file by name `index.html` in any folder of your choice.

The html body is wrapped between `<body>` and `</body>`.

## Headings

So to make a heading for the webpage, in the `<body>` section, add following code.

```html
<h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
```

So there are 6 heading levels, in the order of biggest to smallest.

Now I want you to try out this webpage by opening this html file in the browser of your choice. Everytime you make a change and save file, reload the webpage to see the difference.

# Paragraphs

Now these are the most important of all, the paragraphs. They take up a big chunk of the websites content.

So to create a paragraph, in the `<body>` section below the `<h6>` you just wrote, paste the following code.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
```

And now with all this learnt, I want you to make a basic webpage about any topic you want. This is just for you to get your hands dirty in these basic html tags.
